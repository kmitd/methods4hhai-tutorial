# Characterising HHAI as a Research Field : an Interative Workshop
2025 edition
10-06-2025 HHAI2025 Pisa

## Tutorial Content


## Program

08:30-09:00 Welcome participants

09:00-09:30 Introduction to HHAI and the analytical framework

09:30-10:15 Session 1 - Paper analysis (incl. discussion)

10:15-11:00 Session 2 - Paper analysis (incl. discussion)

11:00-11:45 Session 3 - Paper analysis (incl. discussion)

11:45-12:30 Concept Mapping Session and final remarks (incl. drawing cross-disciplinary collaboration ideas).

(The sessions are planned one after the other, but will be adapted to include a coffee break once the conference program is released.)

## Can I participate?

Of course! The tutorial aims for a broad audience in terms of topics. We are looking for participants that are interested in shaping the future of the HHAI community.

Also, we will have _treats_ for our participants!

<img src="IMG_0060_Ilaria_Tiddi-ab6c9337.webp" alt="ilaria" width="200"/> **Ilaria Tiddi** is an Assistant Professor in Hybrid Intelligence at the Knowledge in AI (KAI) group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (NL). Her research focuses on creating systems that generate complex narratives through a combination of semantic technologies, open data and machine learning, applied mostly in scientific and robotics scenarios.

<img src="" alt="stephanie" width="200"/> **Stephanie Kramer** is a researcher at the ‘Digital Life’ research group at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (NL). Her current research topics include human-centred AI for dementia care, technological support for people with chronic joint illnesses, and an hybrid human-AI educational assistant supporting primary school teachers educating gifted children.

<img src="" alt="michel" width="200"/> **Michel Oey** is a researcher at the ‘Digital Life’ research group at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (NL). Currently his research focuses on using technology, such as sensors, in health-care systems. Examples include remote-monitoring of elderly during their rehabilitation, human-centred AI for dementia-care, a mobile application to support adopting a healthy
life-style, and developing an AI-supported education assistant for gifted children.

<img src="" alt="jessica" width="200"/> **Jessica Sorenson**  is a design anthropologist and postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark. She investigates human relations with emerging technologies, to support the development of ethical and sustainable technological solutions to human problems.  Her research is dedicated to facilitating transdisciplinary collaborations, bridging
the technical and social sciences.

<img src="" alt="Michel" width="200"/> **Adam Dahlgren Lindström** is a postdoctoral researcher in the Responsible AI group at
Umea University in Sweden. His research is on evaluating the capabilities and limitations of multimodal machine learning systems, and how we can build tools for Human-AI interaction in relation to current sociotechnical challenge.
