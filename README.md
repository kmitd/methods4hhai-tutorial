## Introduction

Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is a rapidly growing field aiming at creating collaborative systems where humans and intelligent machines synergistically cooperate in mixed teams towards shared goals. A clear characterisation of the field is still missing, affecting not only standardisation of vocabularies and reuse of design choices, but also how the overall community can identify itself.

In this workshop, we will work toward gathering data to characterise Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) as a research field. In a hands-on session, participants will collaboratively analyse HHAI literature to identify common disciplinary backgrounds, existing and novel methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that are used in the community. Additionally, they will discuss such findings and try to identify interesting transdisciplinary directions for the field in a concept mapping session. 

The result will contribute to a scoping literature review, including a more standardised vocabulary, a set of clear research methods, challenges and future research directions for the HHAI field.

The workshop will also discuss strategies to foster greater interdisciplinary engagement and future activities.


## Program

In this half-day event, we will mix general discussions and hands-on sessions. At first, we will concisely introduce HHAI as a field, as well as the analytical framework for analysing the relevant literature. We will then proceed with a hands-on session where participants will be split into groups and given a HHAI paper to analyse using the introduced framework. At the end of the session, we will discuss progress, problems, and insights. After the coffee break, we will do a concept mapping session, dedicated to gathering collective insights and considering how we might bring our different disciplinary approaches together in the field of HHAI. The concept mapping session will address the following question: "What core elements, perspectives, and approaches define Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence as a distinct and cohesive research domain?"

Tentative Program

[13:30-14:00 Welcome participants]

14:00-14:30 Introduction to HHAI as a research field and introduction to the analytical framework (30 min.)

14:30-16:00 Paper analysis, incl. discussion (90 min.)

16:00-16:30 Coffee break

16:30-18:00 Concept Mapping Session, incl. drawing cross-disciplinary collaboration ideas (90 min.)

## Can I participate?

Of course! The tutorial aims for a broad audience in terms of topics. We are looking for participants that are interested in shaping the future of the HHAI community. The workshop is also a chance for HHAI authors to look introspectively in their own work, matching it against the field’s directions. So everyone is welcome!

You can also contact us at s.kramer2@hva.nl if you want to bring in your own paper (from the HHAI 2025 conference or earlier HHAI conferences) as input for the paper analysis session.

Also, we will have treats for our participants!

## Organisers

<img src="" alt="ilaria" width="200"/> **Ilaria Tiddi** is an Assistant Professor in Hybrid Intelligence at the Knowledge in AI (KAI) group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (NL). Her research focuses on creating systems that generate complex narratives through a combination of semantic technologies, open data and machine learning, applied mostly in scientific and robotics scenarios.

<img src="" alt="stephanie" width="200"/> **Stephanie Kramer** is a researcher at the ‘Digital Life’ research group at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (NL). Her current research topics include human-centred AI for dementia care, technological support for people with chronic joint illnesses, and an hybrid human-AI educational assistant supporting primary school teachers educating gifted children.

<img src="" alt="michel" width="200"/> **Michel Oey** is a researcher at the ‘Digital Life’ research group at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (NL). Currently his research focuses on using technology, such as sensors, in health-care systems. Examples include remote-monitoring of elderly during their rehabilitation, human-centred AI for dementia-care, a mobile application to support adopting a healthy
life-style, and developing an AI-supported education assistant for gifted children.

<img src="" alt="jessica" width="200"/> **Jessica Sorenson**  is a design anthropologist and postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark. She investigates human relations with emerging technologies, to support the development of ethical and sustainable technological solutions to human problems.  Her research is dedicated to facilitating transdisciplinary collaborations, bridging
the technical and social sciences.

<img src="" alt="Michel" width="200"/> **Adam Dahlgren Lindström** is a postdoctoral researcher in the Responsible AI group at
Umea University in Sweden. His research is on evaluating the capabilities and limitations of multimodal machine learning systems, and how we can build tools for Human-AI interaction in relation to current sociotechnical challenge.
